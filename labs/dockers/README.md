Calling a REST API from your Tessel running in a Docker container on Linux hosted in an Azure VM.
=============
In this lab we will run a RESTful service in a Docker container and call it from our Tessel. On the server side we setup a host to run the container and deploy our service to. This lab is a continuation on the Websites lab and the clientside code is identical. On the development machine we will use a lightweight Linux VM to run the xplat-cli command line tools we use to control the Docker host in Azure.


Prerequisites
-------------
In order to successfully complete this lab you need to:

* Have successfully setup your Azure Subscription, your development environment and your Tessel according to instructions outlined in the [Setup Lab](../_setup).
* Download the

* (If the lab uses features, tools or languages that are only available on certain operating systems make sure you specify them here, i.e. PowerShell, Visual Studio, C#, etc.)

Instructions
------------
(Describe the lab here. Divide the lab into logical parts in order for the participant to easily follow along. If possible, describe the steps in the lab using steps that are platform agnostic, i.e. it should work using whatever operating system you want. If possible use Azure-CLI to manage Windows Azure, but also explain how to use the portal if you feel it adds extra value or visibility. Remember that the portal(s) are changing faster than Azure-CLI, so the labs will be easier to maintain if we use Azure-CLI and since the Tessel's programming tools are used from the console, we might as well stick with it as much as possible. The preferred programming language on the server and client side should be JavaScript if possible in order to keep complexity of setup to a minimum.)

Summary
-------
During this lab we have seen that with Docker we can containerize our deployments and thus make more efficient use of our cloud resources in Azure. Containerization enables us to run our application components (API's, Sites, Databases etc.) in lightweight isolated runtimes that are very easy to deploy, interconnect and move to wherever whenever we wish. Containerization can be considered the next step in Platform as a Service and with Azure this scenario is fully supported with Linux and in the near future on Windows VM's as well.
