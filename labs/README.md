Hands on Labs
=============
All provided labs are about connecting the Tessel micro controller to Microsoft Azure. Hence all labs focus on the collaboration between Tessel and Azure and might not go into details of neither Microsoft Azure nore Tessel. With that said they still provide a simple starting point on how to use both the Tessel device as well as Microsoft Azure. For more in depth details, please look at the official documentation for [Azure](http://azure.com) or [Tessel](https://tessel.io).
